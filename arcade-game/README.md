Classic Arcade Game Clone Project
===============================

I originally built this project in 2018 for Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree Program as part of the Grow with Google scholarship I received.

I plan to re-upload this project with all original assets, choosable characters, and a variety of levels, so stay tuned! 

## Instructions

- Play the game by clicking [this link](https://noellekinseydev.github.io/FEND-2018/arcade-game/).
  - Alternatively, you can clone or download this repository, extract the ZIP folder, and play the game by opening ```index.html```.
- The objective of the game is to reach the water without running into a roach. 
- You can move using the arrow keys or by clicking the arrow buttons beneath the game screen.
- Make it across to the water without dying 4 times to win!
