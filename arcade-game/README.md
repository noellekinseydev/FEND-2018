Classic Arcade Game Clone Project
===============================

I originally built this project in 2018 for Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree Program as part of the Grow with Google scholarship I received.

I plan to re-upload this project with all original assets, choosable characters, and a variety of levels, so stay tuned!

## What I Learned

By building this application, I learned about JavaSript's object-oriented programming (OOP) features and discovered various uses for inheritance and delegation. By working with the provided visual assets and game loop engine, I focused on paradigm application architecture to create object-oriented ES6 class functions for optimized performance.
