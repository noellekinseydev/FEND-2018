## Grow with Google 
The [Udacity Grow with Google web developer program](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google "Udacity Grow with Google") grants 1,500 full scholarships to the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. This challenge scholarship is part of the [Grow with Google iniative](https://grow.google/?utm_source=udacity.com&utm_medium=footer_logo&utm_campaign=udacity.com/grow-with-google "Grow with Google campaign").

As one of the top students in Udacity's Web Development learning track, I achieved the Grow with Google scholarship and completed my Front-End Web Development nanodegree in November of 2018.
